## Repository of my website

#### Website

I created my website/portfolio as a means to showcase my capabilities and skills in a visually engaging and accessible format. By designing and developing this platform, I aim to present a comprehensive display of my expertise, experiences, and projects to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. Through carefully curated content and a user-friendly layout, visitors can gain insights into my proficiency in web development and other relevant areas (python, javascript, etc). Additionally, having a personalized website allows me to express my unique style and personality, fostering a more memorable and impactful impression. Overall, my website serves as an interactive representation of my journey and acts as a powerful tool to demonstrate my passion and dedication to the field.
